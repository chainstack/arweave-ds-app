# Drop n' Sell

This repository contains the code neccessary to run the Drop & Sell app, a decentralized app to sell digital documents like ebooks and pdf files.

The application allows users to upload documents to Arweave, a decentralized permanent data store, and list them to sell on Polygon thanks to a smart contract deployed on the blockchain.

## Tech stack

Built with React (Next.js), TailwindCSS, Arweave and Solidity smart contracts deployed on Polygon.

### Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, install all dependencies with `npm i` and run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
